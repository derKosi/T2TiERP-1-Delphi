The migration involves a complete rewrite of the user interface and data access layers, a significant refactoring of business logic, and the replacement of all third-party and Brazil-specific components. The target architecture consists of a WPF desktop client, an ASP.NET Core Web API backend, and a cloud-hosted Azure SQL database, promoting scalability, maintainability, and security.",

It is heavily customized for the Brazilian market, with extensive fiscal and financial modules. The architecture appears to be a traditional Delphi VCL desktop client communicating with a dedicated server application. A migration to C# will require a complete rewrite of the UI and data access layers, significant refactoring of business logic, and replacement of all third-party and Brazil-specific components.",

The presence of 'Comum' and 'Comum Cliente' folders indicates a layered approach with shared units for common functionalities, base forms, and utility classes.

The entire UI must be re-implemented in a .NET technology (WinForms, WPF, Blazor). The logic tightly coupled through data-binding must be carefully extracted and refactored into a modern architecture like MVVM or MVC. Delphi's DFM form definition files must be manually translated to the new UI framework's designer."
